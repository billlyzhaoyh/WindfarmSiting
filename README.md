# Improving Onshore Windfarm Siting

Improving Onshore Windfarm Siting is an industrial colloboration research that aims to locate windier sites for windfarm development Worldwide in a data-driven approach with the help of 'classical machine learning'. It was supported by Engineering Design Centre https://www-edc.eng.cam.ac.uk/ and Wind Pioneers http://www.wind-pioneers.com/.

Student Researcher: Yanhong Zhao (Cambridge University Engineering Part IIB Project)
