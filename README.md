# Improving Onshore Windfarm Siting

Improving Onshore Windfarm Siting is an industrial colloboration research that aims to locate windier sites for windfarm development Worldwide in a data-driven approach with the help of 'classical machine learning'. It was supported by Engineering Design Centre https://www-edc.eng.cam.ac.uk/ and Wind Pioneers http://www.wind-pioneers.com/.

Student Researcher: Yanhong Zhao (Cambridge University Engineering Part IIB Project)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
